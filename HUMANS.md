Let us not forget that software is made for humans (for computers) by humans (on computers). Arcus is no different. Thank you all that have helped, be it by spreading the work of this library, sharing the viral ideas of opensource, provided comments, creating pull requests or even just adding to our usage count.

Arcus exists to be consumed, and all of us involved hoped it has in some way made your day a bit better.
