# Reporting Security Issues

The Arcus team takes security issues in Arcus and our other projects seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security related findings.

We request that if you discover a security significant issue in our library that you report it via email to us at [opensource@sandia.gov](mailto:opensource@sandia.gov). Please include the words "ARCUS" and "SECURITY" in the subject line. **Do not file an issue via the issue tracker**, we'd prefer to avoid publishing security issue details until after we have a fix in place in order to aid in avoiding vulnerability exploitations in the wild.

The Arcus team will do our best alleviate the issue and inform the public as appropriate. After your comment we may reply to your report and ask for additional information.
